# 🤖 Technology & Innovation

> **"Technology is not an end, but a lever that multiplies human intelligence and production capacity."**

This section represents how I transform traditional engineering disciplines with the most advanced technologies of the modern world. By combining years of engineering experience with **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Edge AI**, and **Digital Transformation** tools, I focus on innovative solutions that make processes smarter, faster, and error-free.

## 📂 Innovative Projects & Focus Areas

### 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Automation Tools
Tools that optimize engineering documentation and workflows using LLMs (Large Language Models).

* 🧠 **[translate](https://github.com/askinkeles/translate)**: A GPT-4o based, intelligent translation tool that automatically localizes GitHub Markdown documents without compromising technical accuracy.
* 🤖 **Prompt Engineering**: Strategic use of generative AI in technical documentation, code review, and system design processes.

---

### 2. Digital Transformation & System Optimization
Digitization of industrial processes and next-generation architectures focused on efficiency.

* 📈 **Process Automation**: Software infrastructures that digitize manual workflows, minimize human error, and enable "Data-Driven" decision-making.
* ☁️ **Cloud & Infrastructure Modernization**: Transforming systems into modern, secure, and scalable structures based on experience gained in large-scale public projects.

---

### 3. Future Vision: Edge AI & TinyML
The intersection of Embedded Systems and Artificial Intelligence.

* 🎯 **Edge Intelligence**: Studies on running AI algorithms directly on microcontrollers (ESP32, STM32) to perform on-site analysis without needing the cloud.
* ⚡ **TinyML Applications**: Processing sensor data on edge devices with machine learning models for smart decision-making processes.

## 💡 Innovation Philosophy

Innovation is not just about inventing something new; it is about bringing the **simplest, fastest, and most efficient** solution to existing problems. My approach to innovation is based on three pillars:

1. **Simplification:** Making complex systems easily understandable for the end-user.
2. **Scalability:** Ensuring that the solution produced today can respond to tomorrow's growth.
3. **Benefit-Oriented:** Using technology not just for the sake of it, but to solve a real-world problem.
