# 🧱 Technical Expertise (Engineering & Embedded)

> **"From physics principles to firmware architecture; I merge the soul of hardware with software."**

This section encompasses my expertise in the hardware and software layers at the heart of embedded systems, the libraries I have developed, and my engineering methodologies based on industrial standards. Here, you will find not just code snippets, but an engineering discipline focused on system integrity.

## 📂 Technical Portfolio & Repositories

I categorize my areas of expertise into the following three main pillars:

### 1. Embedded Software & Communication Architecture (Firmware)
Asynchronous, reliable, and high-performance communication drivers managing data flow between complex systems.

* 📡 **[Embedded-UART-Guide](https://github.com/askinkeles/Embedded-UART-Guide)**: Industrial UART/RS-485 guide. Ring Buffer management and asynchronous data parsing.
* 🏎️ **[Embedded-CANBus-Guide](https://github.com/askinkeles/Embedded-CANBus-Guide)**: ESP32 TWAI (CAN Bus) protocol. Hardware filtering and error management.
* ⚡ **[Embedded-SPI-Guide](https://github.com/askinkeles/Embedded-SPI-Guide)**: High-speed SPI communication and DMA (Direct Memory Access) integration.
* 🛰️ **[Embedded-I2C-Guide](https://github.com/askinkeles/Embedded-I2C-Guide)**: Robust I2C networks. Bus Recovery and slave management.
* 📜 **[Industrial-Serial-Comms-Guide](https://github.com/askinkeles/Industrial-Serial-Comms-Guide)**: Technical documentation on industrial serial communication standards.

---

### 2. Embedded Hardware & PCB Design (Hardware)
Physical layer design; approaches focused on signal integrity, power management, and industrial durability.

* 🧩 **PCB Design Principles**: Layer stackup, differential pair routing, and impedance matching techniques.
* 🛡️ **EMI/EMC & Isolation**: TVS protection for industrial environments, galvanic isolation, and noise suppression strategies.
* 🔋 **Power Management**: Buck/Boost converter designs and Battery Management Systems (BMS) integration.
* *(Documentation in this section will soon be expanded or added as a new repository.)*

---

### 3. Drivers & Universal Libraries
Modular libraries capable of running on different platforms using Hardware Abstraction Layers (HAL).

* 🖥️ **[DWIN_UNI_HMI](https://github.com/askinkeles/DWIN_UNI_HMI)**: Universal, platform-independent library developed for DWIN DGUS II screens.
* 📦 **[library-registry](https://github.com/askinkeles/library-registry)**: Library management and registry processes for the open-source ecosystem.
