# 💼 Strategic Management & Leadership

> **"Management is not just about handling resources; it is the art of setting the system's course with data-driven strategic insights."**

This section reflects the strategic mindset, management models, and decision support mechanisms I have distilled throughout my career journey from public administration to technology leadership. It offers a vision of how I combine an analytical perspective rooted in engineering with corporate management strategies to make complex structures more efficient, traceable, and sustainable.

## 📂 Strategic Focus Areas & Models

### 1. Decision Support Models & Analysis Frameworks
Methodological tools I utilize to support complex managerial decisions with objective data.

* 🧠 **[strategic-decision-models](https://github.com/askinkeles/strategic-decision-models)**: A fundamental guide treating strategic analysis models like SWOT, PESTEL, and Porter's Five Forces from an engineering perspective.
* 📊 **Risk Management & Simulation**: Modeling used in the processes of identifying, analyzing, and minimizing corporate risks.

### 2. Corporate Efficiency & Public Administration Strategies
Operational management approaches I have implemented in large-scale public projects and institutions.

* 💰 **Performance-Based Budgeting**: Planning resources in alignment with strategic goals and result-oriented spending discipline.
* 📈 **DSS (Decision Support Systems)**: Design of dashboard architectures and data interpretation to enable senior executives to make fast and accurate decisions.
* 📜 **Business Process Modeling**: Optimization of workflows and simplification of bureaucracy within the framework of ISO 9001 and similar quality standards.

---

### 3. Technology Leadership & Team Management
A human-oriented management philosophy where technical expertise meets administrative leadership.

* 🤝 **Agile Management**: Hybrid management methodologies ensuring technical teams work with high motivation and efficiency.
* 🚀 **Strategic HR Planning**: Creation of technical competency matrices and in-house talent management processes.

## 💡 Management Philosophy

My management understanding merges the deterministic nature of physics engineering with the dynamism of social sciences. Accordingly, I advocate these three principles:

1. **Data-Driven:** You cannot manage what you cannot measure. Every strategic step must be based on concrete data and analysis.
2. **Sustainability:** Solutions should not just save the day; they must be structured to contribute to corporate memory and remain scalable in the future.
3. **Transparency & Accountability:** Management processes must be clear, understandable, and auditable through performance criteria.
